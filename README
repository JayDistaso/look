This program is a homemade implementation of the standard unix "look" utility
A description of the original can be found at http://linux.die.net/man/1/look
Relevant sections that apply to both original and this look utility are detailed below.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Name:
look - display lines beginning with a given string

Synopsis:
look [-df] [-t termchar] string [file]

Description:
The look utility displays any lines in file which contain string as a prefix.
As look performs a binary search, the lines in file must be sorted (where sort got the 
same options -d and/or -f that look is invoked with).

If file is not specified, the file /usr/share/dict/words is used, 
only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic characters is ignored.

Options:
-d' Dictionary character set and order, i.e. only alphanumericcharacters are compared. (On by default if no file specified).
-f' Ignore the case of alphabetic characters. (On by default if no file specified).

-t' Specify a string termination character, i.e. only the characters in string up to and including the first occurrence of termchar are compared.

Return Values:
The look utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found and displayed, 1 if no lines were found, and >1 if an error occurred.

Files
/usr/share/dict/words
the dictionary

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
How to use
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Assuming you have all the files in the same directory (not including the dictionary which should be at /usr/share/dict/words)

Required Files: look.c look.h Makefile
Optional Files: runn.txt

To complile $make

To run fomrat like $look [-d and/or -f] [-t TERM_CHAR] string [file]
example runs
"$look string" Would search dictionary for lines containing as a prefix string  
"$look -d string file" Would search file for lines starting with string, ignoring non alphanumeric chacters
"$look -f string file" Would search file for lines starting with string, ignoring case while comparing
"$look -t i string file" Would search file for lines starting with stri, ignoring everything after the terminating charcter (-ng)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using the testing script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
!!!!!!!!!
CAUTION:
   Script will modify files (removing carriage returns) as well as use staley turnin utilty to handin project
   Do not use without suitable backups
!!!!!!!!!
Also Included is a bash script used for testing this program with the standard unix utility.
To use first change permisions of runn.txt so it can be executed if necessary
then execute the file with all the Required Files in the same directory as runn.txt

*********************
How the script works
*********************
The script will first scrub carriage returns from look.c and look.h
the scipt assumes your file is named text, and will sort it and output
to a file called txts
It will then run through various tests, outputting a small description of each test
The outputs of eah run will be stored as a file
Then the outputs will be diffed in a block, if there are differences you will see them in the diff block

After testing is complete the script will upload the files to staleys turnin folder
